*Andres Ramirez*

This project is part of my curriculum as I progress through Flatiron School's Data Science program.


## Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to suggest a strategy for movie production for the Microsoft Corporation based on data pulled from IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TMDb and Box Office Mojo.

Information needed from this exploration includes:

- What genres of movies do best in theaters?
- What ratings encompass the highest grossing movies?
- How much return is expected on production costs?

## Methods:
- Data Cleaning
- SQL Querying
- Data Visualization

## Technologies:
- Python
- SQLite
- Pandas, Jupyter
- Google Slides

## Data Used:
- IMDb Data
- Rotten Tomatoes Data
- Box Office Mojo Data
- TMDb Data

## Project Description
This project's intent is to provide a plan for how Microsoft can make the jump into producing movies. It outlines the financial expectations, personnel considerations, as well as content considerations that will bring the most success to this venture.
